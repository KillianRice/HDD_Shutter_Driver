# HDD_Shutter_Driver

HDD shutter driver circuit based on Rob Scholten's 2007 RSI paper (see below). Modifications include the option of using an IXDF604PI instead of the expensive LMD18200 to drive the shutter. 

Outputs are to standard BNC connectors so care should be taken to avoid shorting to ground.
